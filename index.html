		<h2>“Science for everyone – because it matters!”</h2>
		<p>Even in the 21st century there are still people out there who believe <bold>ART</bold> and <bold>SCIENCE</bold> are polar opposites, 
		but nothing could be further from the truth: Art has no content, no material, without science, and science comes down to passionless numbers 
		without art. But most importantly, they both need their symbiosis when it comes to one of their core aspect of existence: Communication! Research communication is an art form by itself. Finding the right words, the right image to communicate complex scientific contents, to break it down for everyone to get excited about brilliant ideas: that is what makes science matter!</p>
